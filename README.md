`qqr` (a.k.a. hilichurl) is a lightweight, non-intrusive extension for [`slime`](https://github.com/THUDM/slime). It seamlessly integrates the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) standard to enable the evolution of open-ended agents via [**ArenaRL**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06487).

## 🌟 Key Features

- **ArenaRL Algorithm**: Full implementation of the core algorithms described in the paper. It includes built-in topologies for Anchor-Based, Round-Robin, Swiss-System, Double-Elimination, and Seeded Single-Elimination tournaments.
- **Built for Open-Ended Agents**: Specifically engineered to tackle discriminative collapse in complex, open-ended tasks, ensuring continuous policy improvement via relative ranking even when reward model scores stagnate.
- **MCP Support**: Seamlessly integration with the [MCP]((https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol)) standardizes the decoupling of LLM inference and tool environments. Developers can reuse existing MCP Servers as training environments without rewriting interfaces.
- **High-Performance Training**: Built on top of [`slime`](https://github.com/THUDM/slime) (tested with `v0.2.1`) to deliver high-throughput, distributed rollout generation and training for large-scale agent evolution.

## 📦 Installation

To get started, first ensure [`slime`](https://github.com/THUDM/slime) is installed (refer to [Quick Start](https://thudm.github.io/slime/get_started/quick_start.html)). Then install `qqr` from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/qqr.git
cd qqr
pip install -e .
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

Run the travel experiment quickly with the following command:

```bash
bash scripts/travel/run-qwen3-8B.sh
```

You can configure the experiment in [`qqr/examples/travel/config.py`](qqr/examples/travel/config.py).
